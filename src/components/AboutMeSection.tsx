          <p className="text-lg mt-6 text-body">
            Hello there, I'm Maytiya Monburinonâ€”or just May! My fascination with
            computers started at an early age, and it's been a part of my life
            ever since.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mt-6 text-body">
            Back in 2010, I discovered the joy of building things with no-code
            tools. The satisfaction of making something work sparked a lifelong
            interest that eventually led me to software engineering.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mt-6 text-body">
            Today, as a software engineer with over 4 years of experience, I've
            worked on a variety of SaaS products, guided teams, and mentoring
            junior developers. My expertise lies in React and Node.js, and I'm
            passionate about crafting aesthetically pleasing and impactful
            websites that truly make a difference for users. I value writing
            clean, high-quality code, and I'm currently into exploring new
            technologies to create unique, engaging visuals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mt-6 text-body">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games,
            binge-watching Netflix, reading books, or playing music.
